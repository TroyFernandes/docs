# Introduction

I've been self-hosting & homelabbing since 2016 and I often times find myself in this scenario:

```
> Find something interesting on Github/Reddit
> Learn how to set it up in a test environment
> Move on & forget about it
> Months later it shows up again
> I have some hardware that I can run this on permanently
> Forget how I set it up originally & can't find the guides again
> ...
```

I always prefer text guides over any other medium + it's always a bonus when they're short. 

So here's my version of that; very informal docs on things I've setup, to refer back to.

Maybe you'll find it useful.
